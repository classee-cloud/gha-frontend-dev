# GitHub Application for Managing CI Infrastructure

This is a simple GitHub Application for managing build requests. It works in concert with [ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge](https://github.com/ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge) to automatically launch GitHub Actions Runners as Slurm jobs. 

This app is trusted by GitHub (must be installed as a GitHub App), and can act on behalf of users who trigger builds on GitHub Actions. [ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge](https://github.com/ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge) are the components that need to be trusted by Slurm (e.g. run in your munge domain, as the SlurmUser).

The high level workflow to launch a build runner is:
1. Receive webhook from GitHub that a build is needed, check the labels on the requested runner
2. Generate a self-signed JWT token that encodes the build request, send this to [ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge](https://github.com/ripley-cloud/gha-slurm-munge) to request that an actions runner be scheduled to run in Slurm
3. Once the Slurm Job is allocated, the node sends the JWT token back to this app, which checks it, and then if valid, refreshes the GitHub runner token (the slurm job might wait in the scheduler for so long that the token expired, which is why there is this intermediate step).
4. Actions runner starts and connects to GitHub. If there is no build started within 2 minutes (e.g. if the request was satisfied by another runner outside of our control, or canceled by the user), the job terminates and releases its resources

    participant GHA as GitHub Actions

    participant Slurm as Slurm Trusted App
    participant Runner as GitHub Runner on Slurm

    GHA-->>GHApp: WebHook: workflow_job queued
    GHApp-->>Slurm: CIManager.launchWorker post /runner/start 
    Slurm-->>Runner: Launch Runner
    Runner-->>GHApp: Request token to create new runner on GitHub (POST /gha/runner)
    GHApp-->>Runner: Respond with token to use to create runner
    Runner-->>GHA: Create new "ephemeral" runner
    GHA-->>Runner: Start running a job (GH picks next in queue)
    Note right of GHA: Assuming that there is still a job to start
    GHA-->>GHApp: WebHook: workflow_job started
```

### Workflow for configuring mapping from repo to project

This app will expose a REST API for viewing and updating list of repos mapped to a user:
* GET /repositories/:username
 * Returns the list of repositories mapped to :username
* POST /repositories/:username
 * Update the entire list of repositories mapped to :username
 
There will be a simple React frontend application for interacting with that API (`npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`). Communicate with backend by making HTTP requests (axios/fetch/etc).
